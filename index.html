                <h3>Name</h3>
                <p>Gesaffelstein is a portmanteau of Gesamtkunstwerk ("total artwork" in German, also title of an album
                    by the American electro group Dopplereffekt) and Albert Einstein.</p>

                <h3>Musical style</h3>
                <p>Mixmag describes Gesaffelstein's style as being a "dark and threatening techno, though
                    enchanting";[20] The Inrocks see it as "black, ultra-violent music, [which] revives the techno
                    fundamentals, the intransigence of Underground Resistance, the mental and obsessive structures of
                    Drexciya, the contemporary power and more".[6] Megan Buerger from the Washington Post describes his
                    style has a mixture of dark and underground music, and notes that a specialty of the artist is his
                    use of silences to create a "tension" before a "raucous explosion of bass and percussion".[21]
                    Rolling Stone magazine sees his music as being "a little more aggressive and punk-rock than normal".
